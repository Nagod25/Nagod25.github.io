                                            <h2>What is StashBox?</h2>
                                                <p>STASHBOX is a savings and investment platform where you save or invest; save with or
                                                    without tenure; in Naira or USD; short term or long term; with card or wallet; save
                                                    individually or in groups. StashBox is a product of Stash Fintech Ltd incorporated in Nigeria
                                                    with RC 1467750.
                                                    Stash Fintech Ltd is in partnership with Afrinvest Trustees Ltd, a duly licensed company by
                                                    the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) in Nigeria. Stash Fintech Ltd is related to
                                                    Stash Fintech Cooperative Ltd, a microfinance institution registered with FCT, Abuja.
                                                    STASHBOX is a combination of two words “Stash” and “Box”. Stash means to store
                                                    something somewhere. A Box is a place to keep valuable items secretly and securely.
                                                    Therefore, STASHBOX is a digital box where you store or stash funds securely.
                                                    STASHBOX is like an Omnibus. An omnibus is a bus with many rooms in it. StashBox, like
                                                    an omnibus allows you to save, invest and enjoy other financial services all in one app.
                                                    All processes are designed to be contactless, paperless and 100% end to end. On-lending
                                                    refers to loans to pharmaceuticals, employees of the federal government; individuals who
                                                    want to acquire assets like cars.

                                        These plans are named after precious stones and in terms of hierarchy the Diamond stone is
                                        the least valued. The value of the stones increases with the tenor a customer desires to save. This shows you the sophistication and level of thought process that was put into these products. However, Casual plan and Wadiah plans are not named after stones because they are different from the others.

                                        In contrast to traditional banking methods, Islamic finance as stipulated by the Quran
                                        discourages any predetermined payment on funds collection. It is perceived as haram
                                        (sin). The Islamic finance encourages mutual risk and reward sharing on savings or loans
                                        between both business partners. It is believed that the concept of pre-determining the
                                        interest put the two parties in a master/slave business relationship.

                                    savings based on your periodic savings amount and tenure. The system is intelligent
                                    enough to calculate the total amount of savings at the end of the tenure. Also, you
                                    get to see the projected interest.</p>

                                    This works like a fixed deposit. You can invest between 10,000-
                                    3,000,000 Naira or even more. Investment is done in Naira NGN.
                                    Saving plans can be recurring but Investment is one-off just like
                                    the casual savings plan.
                                    An investment plan once created cannot be withdrawn until
                                    maturity. If you initiate a 6-month investment plan, you have to
                                    wait till 6 months. Emergency withdrawal is not allowed.
                                    Interests accrue daily for investments; however, interest can be
                                    withdrawn upfront.
                                    For example, if you invest one million naira (N1,000,000) for 12
                                    months at an interest rate of 8%, you can withdraw your
                                    N80,000 interest upfront

                                Once the SMS OTP Code is inputted on the StashBox app

                                Upon successful N50 debit, the card is activated on the app and stored for daily, weekly or
                                monthly plan activation.
                                Visa, Master, Verve, AMEX and all types of cards can be added.
                                Multiple cards can be added on the same account.
                                Added Cards can be activated or deactivated on the app.
                                Any of the activated cards can be used to fund the savings plan.

                                    that, a virtual account will be created for you.</p>
